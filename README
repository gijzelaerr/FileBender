INTRODUCTION
============

This is filebender, the django clone of filesender. I use this for prototyping
things that probably will be implemented into filesender.

FileSender and FileBender are client side software to share (large) files over
HTTP using a browser only. It supports large files. FileBender also supports
client side file encryption.
