INTRODUCTION
============

This is filebender, the django clone of filesender. I use this for prototyping
things that probably will be implemented into filesender.

FileSender and FileBender are client side software to share (large) files over
HTTP using a browser only. It supports large files. FileBender also supports
client side file encryption.

PERFORMANCE
===========

Encryption speed at 5MB chunks with default crypt settings is about 1.8MB/s
on a Intel 2500K met 16GB mem with Google Chrome. Upload doesn't require
a lot of memory, but download does. This is because the file needs to be
reconstructed in memory. Maybe LocalStorage Javascript can solve this in the
future.
